# SageTV Plugin Repository for V9

testin

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/OpenSageTV/sagetv-plugin-repo.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/OpenSageTV/sagetv-plugin-repo)

This is a plugin repository (ie, XML manifest repository) for SageTV V9 Open Source Plugins.

Developers should clone this repository, then add a new plugin under the `plugins` directory.

You can add more than one xml in your folder, but, the start and end of each xml file should be

`<SageTVPlugin>...</SageTVPlugin>`

ie, the plugin xml is exactly the same as your Plugin's Manifest.

If you don't want to host your manifest file in this repo, you can create a plugin entry in the `plugins` directory, and create one or more `.url` files that contain a single line that resolves to your plugin manifest xml.  In this way, you can keep your manifest file in your own repository, and simply link to it from here.

When you commit your changes, create a `PULL REQUEST` and your plugin manifest will be included (at some timed interval, usually once a day, or sooner)

Do not edit the `SageTVPluginsV9.xml` file.  This file is automatically re-generated based on the content in the `plugins` directory.

Please note there is no code in this git repo.  This repo is strictly for maintaining the SageTV V9 Plugin Repository XML manifest files.  Your actual plugin should exist elsewhere in a git repository.
